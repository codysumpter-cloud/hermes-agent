# Market and Sports Trend Intelligence

## Overview

This skill helps Hermes monitor public market and sports-betting discourse, identify narratives, track stock/sector/macro/sports signals, create educational risk briefs, build watchlists, and turn timely themes into Prismtek-native content ideas.

It is a research, education, and content-intelligence skill. It must not place trades, place bets, deposit funds, withdraw funds, sign wallet transactions, open brokerage/sportsbook accounts, route orders, chase losses, or claim guaranteed returns.

## When to Use

Use this skill when Prismtek wants to:

- watch current stock-market trends, AI-stock narratives, sector rotations, earnings themes, macro catalysts, crypto narratives, or retail-investor chatter;
- watch sports betting trends, line movement discourse, public betting narratives, injury/news uncertainty, and model-risk topics;
- learn which market/sports topics are driving attention on X and YouTube;
- create educational analysis, risk notes, watchlists, and content drafts;
- create manual-review stock or sports-bet decision packets without execution;
- generate X posts, YouTube Shorts, long-form outlines, and KnowledgeVault notes from trending market/sports topics.

Do not use this skill to automate trading, automate betting, provide guarantees, pressure action, or bypass platform, broker, sportsbook, wallet, or jurisdiction controls.

## Approved Sources

Approved read sources may include:

- public X/Twitter search results, public accounts, public lists, screenshots, and exported bookmarks;
- public YouTube videos, transcripts, channel pages, and comments where allowed;
- official company investor relations pages, SEC/EDGAR filings, earnings releases, and exchange notices;
- official league/team injury reports, schedules, box scores, and news releases;
- reputable market data, odds data, price charts, and macro calendars;
- KnowledgeVault notes, prior receipts, and approved user-provided research.

Do not scrape private groups, paid communities, closed Discords, private DMs, paywalled material, or account data without explicit user approval and legal access.

## Workflow

1. Define the research window, source list, and target domains: stocks, macro, crypto, sports, betting, or content opportunities.
2. Gather public signals from X, YouTube, official sources, and approved data feeds.
3. Classify signals by type:
   - market narrative,
   - catalyst,
   - earnings/event risk,
   - sentiment spike,
   - sports news/injury uncertainty,
   - line-movement narrative,
   - model-risk theme,
   - content opportunity,
   - skill/tool idea.
4. Separate facts, source claims, market chatter, and inference.
5. Produce educational briefs and watchlists with uncertainty and downside risk clearly labeled.
6. Create content drafts for X/YouTube using Prismtek's operator-infrastructure framing.
7. If the user asks about a possible stock purchase or bet, produce a manual-review decision packet rather than executing.
8. Require explicit user approval for any public post, outreach action, or regulated financial/sportsbook action.
9. Write a KnowledgeVault digest and receipt.

## Manual-Review Decision Packet

When the user asks for trade or bet help, output this structure:

```txt
Decision Packet
- Asset / event / market:
- User thesis:
- Source facts:
- Chatter / sentiment:
- Key catalysts:
- Key risks:
- Missing information:
- Time horizon:
- Position sizing considerations:
- No-action case:
- Educational analysis:
- Content angle:
- Manual action required: yes
- Agent execution allowed: no
```

For stocks, include:

```txt
- Business/sector context
- Catalyst calendar
- Valuation/earnings uncertainty if available
- Liquidity/volatility risk
- Portfolio concentration risk
- What would invalidate the thesis
```

For sports betting, include:

```txt
- Event and market wording
- Injury/news uncertainty
- Public narrative versus source-backed facts
- Model/sample-size limitations
- Line movement context if available
- Bankroll/loss-limit reminder
- Reasons to pass
```

## Content Outputs

For every run, suggest content without making unsupported claims:

```txt
Content Opportunities
- 5 X post drafts
- 2 X thread outlines
- 3 YouTube Short hooks
- 1 long-form YouTube outline
- 3 KnowledgeVault notes to create
- 3 trend follow-ups to monitor
```

Content must avoid:

- guaranteed profit language;
- financial advice claims;
- "lock," "free money," or "can't lose" betting language;
- fake results;
- copied influencer posts;
- undisclosed sponsorship/promotion;
- claims that Prismtek placed trades or bets unless a user-provided receipt verifies the user took that action manually.

## Approval and Execution Rules

Allowed without approval:

- read public sources;
- summarize public market/sports discourse;
- create watchlists;
- explain odds, volatility, implied probability, and risk concepts;
- draft content;
- draft manual-review decision packets;
- create KnowledgeVault notes.

Requires explicit approval:

- publishing X/YouTube content;
- tagging/mentioning accounts;
- replying, quoting, reposting, liking, following, or DMing;
- joining external communities;
- opening brokerage/sportsbook/wallet pages;
- preparing any broker/sportsbook/wallet action for manual review.

Blocked:

- placing stock, options, crypto, prediction-market, or sportsbook orders;
- depositing, withdrawing, transferring, or signing transactions;
- bypassing jurisdiction, broker, sportsbook, exchange, or platform controls;
- pretending to be a licensed financial advisor;
- promising returns;
- encouraging loss chasing;
- using private account data without approval;
- hammering rate-limited or blocked routes.

## KnowledgeVault Targets

Default write targets:

```txt
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/market-sports-digests/
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/market-watchlists/
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/sports-risk-briefs/
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/post-ideas/
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/youtube-production/
KnowledgeVault/99-System/Agent Skills/candidates/
```

Never write raw credentials, brokerage tokens, sportsbook credentials, wallet keys, private DMs, or non-public personal data into KnowledgeVault.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not confuse viral market chatter with reliable information.
- Do not treat X sentiment as a buy/sell signal by itself.
- Do not treat line movement as proof of edge.
- Do not ignore liquidity, volatility, spreads, fees, taxes, slippage, or account limits.
- Do not overfit to small sports samples.
- Do not make personalized financial claims beyond educational analysis and user-directed manual review.
- Do not turn content into hype that encourages irresponsible trading or betting.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing a run:

- Sources and time window are listed.
- Facts, claims, and inference are separated.
- Risk and no-action cases are included.
- No trade or bet execution is attempted.
- Watchlists are labeled as watchlists, not recommendations.
- Content drafts avoid guaranteed-profit language.
- KnowledgeVault paths are sanitized.
- Any external action requires explicit approval and a receipt.
