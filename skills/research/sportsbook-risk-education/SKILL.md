# Sportsbook Risk Education

## Overview

This skill helps Hermes and Buddy explain uncertainty, probability language, loss exposure, responsible-use boundaries, and no-action reasoning for sportsbook-style discussions. It is educational only and never executes or queues financial activity.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants a sober risk review, probability literacy, responsible-use checklist, or help identifying why no action may be the safest option.

Do not use it to place, route, automate, optimize, or encourage gambling activity.

## Workflow

1. Restate the uncertainty and the user-provided assumptions.
2. Explain what information is missing or unreliable.
3. Identify downside, emotional decision risks, and loss-limit considerations.
4. Present non-executing educational notes and no-action reasons.
5. Require the user to make any regulated decision outside the agent.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not imply guaranteed outcomes.
- Do not pressure action.
- Do not encourage loss chasing.
- Do not access accounts or funds.

## Verification Checklist

- Output is educational.
- No execution path is provided.
- No profit guarantee appears.
- No account, credential, or payment action is requested.
