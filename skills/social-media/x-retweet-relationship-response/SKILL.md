# X Retweet Relationship Response

## Overview

This skill monitors Prismtek X posts for reposts/retweets and turns those signals into thoughtful relationship-building. It is designed to help Prismtek thank supporters, identify aligned builders, draft useful replies, and create KnowledgeVault relationship notes.

This is not a spam bot. It must not mass-reply, mass-like, mass-DM, or post repetitive promotional copy. It should prioritize quality, personalization, and account safety.

## Primary Use Case

When a Prismtek post gets reposted/retweeted:

1. Detect the repost event.
2. Identify the retweeter/reposter.
3. Inspect only public profile/post context.
4. Classify the retweeter:
   - builder/developer;
   - AI/tools creator;
   - creator/community account;
   - customer/prospect;
   - unknown/low-context;
   - suspicious/spam.
5. Decide the safest response path.
6. Write a KnowledgeVault relationship receipt.
7. Queue a thank-you reply or outreach draft when appropriate.
8. Require explicit approval before replies, DMs, quote posts, follows, or mentions unless the user has configured a narrow allowlist.

## Default Automation Policy

Allowed automatically after the user enables this skill for a specific X account:

- read repost/retweet events;
- deduplicate retweeters;
- create KnowledgeVault relationship notes;
- create post/reply/DM drafts;
- classify risk level;
- optionally like the retweeter's repost once if configured and rate limits are healthy.

Requires explicit approval by default:

- reply to the retweeter;
- quote post;
- tag/mention the retweeter;
- DM;
- follow;
- repost their content;
- publish any promotional call-to-action.

Blocked:

- duplicate replies to the same retweeter/post pair;
- identical generic replies under every repost;
- automated DMs;
- mass following;
- mass liking;
- aggressive retries after route/auth/platform friction;
- outreach to suspicious/spam accounts;
- fake personalization;
- claiming partnership, endorsement, or friendship that does not exist.

## Recommended Response Ladder

Use the lowest-risk useful response.

### Level 0 — Receipt Only

Use when the account is unknown, low-context, suspicious, or high-risk.

Actions:

- write receipt;
- do not engage;
- optionally add to watchlist.

### Level 1 — Like Only

Use when the retweeter appears legitimate but no strong relationship signal exists.

Actions:

- like once if user has enabled auto-like;
- write receipt;
- no reply.

### Level 2 — Thank-You Reply Draft

Use when the retweeter is relevant to Prismtek.

Actions:

- draft a personalized reply;
- queue for approval;
- do not publish automatically by default.

### Level 3 — Relationship Outreach Draft

Use when the retweeter is a strong builder/community fit.

Actions:

- create relationship note;
- draft public reply;
- draft optional DM;
- queue for explicit approval.

## Reply Style

Replies must be short, human, and specific.

Good patterns:

```txt
Appreciate the repost — building this in public so the receipts stay visible.
```

```txt
Thanks for sharing this. Prismtek is focused on the memory + execution layer for useful agents.
```

```txt
Appreciate you boosting this. If local-first agents / durable memory are your lane too, I’d be glad to compare notes.
```

Avoid repetitive generic CTA spam like:

```txt
Thanks for the repost! DM me if you want to work together!
```

Use a DM/work-together CTA sparingly and only when context supports it.

## Outreach Draft Template

```txt
Retweet Relationship Candidate
- Source post:
- Retweeter handle:
- Public profile summary:
- Why they may matter:
- Risk level:
- Suggested response level:
- Draft public reply:
- Optional DM draft:
- Approval required: yes
```

## Rate Limits and Safety Caps

Recommended defaults:

- max auto-likes per day: 10;
- max queued reply drafts per day: 10;
- max approved published replies per day: 3;
- max DMs per day: 0 by default;
- minimum delay between engagement actions: 20 minutes;
- never retry failed engagement routes more than once;
- stop immediately on auth, friction, suspicious-activity, or platform-limit errors.
