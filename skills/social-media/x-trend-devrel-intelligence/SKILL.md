# X Trend DevRel Intelligence

## Overview

This skill helps Hermes monitor public X/Twitter discourse, AI development stacks, developer conversations, repo launches, tool announcements, and builder communities. It turns those signals into KnowledgeVault notes, post ideas, relationship maps, and approval-gated outreach drafts.

This is not a spam, scraping, or mass-DM skill. It must not automatically follow, like, repost, reply, DM, tag, mention, or contact people. It drafts and queues relationship-building actions for explicit approval.

## When to Use

Use this skill when Prismtek wants to:

- find trending AI, agent, developer-tooling, local-first, open-source, or creative-coding topics;
- identify developers, builders, maintainers, creators, and communities worth following;
- map useful AI development stacks and toolchains;
- create X posts or threads based on timely public signals;
- draft thoughtful outreach messages, replies, or collaboration notes;
- update KnowledgeVault with recurring trends, people, repos, skills, and content opportunities.

Do not use this skill to mass-message, scrape private data, impersonate, astroturf, manipulate engagement, or bypass platform limits.

## Signal Sources

Approved read sources may include:

- public X search results and public profiles;
- the user's approved X lists/bookmarks/exports;
- public GitHub repos and release notes;
- public blogs, docs, newsletters, and launch posts;
- KnowledgeVault notes and prior Prismtek receipts;
- approved local browser session reads when public/isolated reads are unavailable.

Write-capable social routes are external-action risk and require explicit approval.

## Workflow

1. Define the research window, target themes, and approved sources.
2. Search or inspect public signals for AI/dev-stack trends and builder conversations.
3. Extract trends, accounts, repos, stacks, claims, links, and open questions.
4. Classify each signal:
   - trend to monitor,
   - content opportunity,
   - person to follow manually,
   - possible collaborator,
   - repo/tool to research,
   - skill idea for Hermes/Buddy,
   - KnowledgeVault update.
5. Create a KnowledgeVault trend digest with citations or source links where available.
6. Draft X posts, threads, or replies as queue candidates with exact text and intended audience.
7. Draft outreach messages only as manual-review candidates.
8. Require explicit approval before any external action.
9. After approved public actions, write a receipt with timestamp, route, URL, and uncertainty.

## Output Format

For each run, produce:

```txt
Trend Digest
- Window:
- Sources checked:
- Top trends:
- Notable builders/accounts:
- Notable repos/tools:
- AI/dev stacks observed:
- Prismtek content angles:
- Skill ideas:
- Outreach candidates:
- Risks/uncertainty:
- Next approved actions:
```

For outreach candidates, include:

```txt

Risk level:
Approval required: yes
```

## Outreach Rules

Allowed without approval:

- identify public accounts or repos;
- summarize public posts;
- draft replies or DMs;
- suggest people to follow;
- create a relationship map;
- create KnowledgeVault notes.

Requires explicit approval:

- follow;
- like;
- repost;
- reply;
- quote post;
- DM;
- tag or mention a person;
- subscribe;
- join a Discord/Slack/community;
- open a pull request or issue;
- send email;
- publish any post.

Blocked:

- spam or mass outreach;
- fake personalization;
- scraping private or non-public data;
- exporting cookies or sessions;
- bypassing X limits or anti-abuse systems;
- harassment or dogpiling;
- undisclosed paid promotion;
- pretending Prismtek has a relationship that does not exist.

## KnowledgeVault Updates

Default write targets:

```txt
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/trend-digests/
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/outreach-drafts/
KnowledgeVault/50 - Content/post-ideas/
KnowledgeVault/99-System/Agent Skills/candidates/
```

Never write raw credentials, cookies, tokens, private DMs, private emails, or unapproved personal data into KnowledgeVault.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not mistake trending for strategically useful.
- Do not copy viral posts; extract structure and make Prismtek-native commentary.
- Do not imply friendship, endorsement, or partnership from public engagement.
- Do not overfit content to every trend; Prismtek's lane is durable memory, guarded execution, local-first agents, dev tools, and receipts.
- Do not publish based on unverified claims without labeling uncertainty.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing a run:

- Sources are approved and public or user-provided.
- Trend digest separates facts from inferences.
- Outreach is draft-only unless approved.
- No mass outreach is proposed.
- No private data or secrets are stored.
- X posts are queued with exact text/hash when publishing is requested.
- KnowledgeVault paths are sanitized.
- Any external action has a receipt requirement.
